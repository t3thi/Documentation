# Translation Handling Initiative: Monthly report

**January 2025**

[← Back to the overview](https://notes.typo3.org/s/f3ae8fZSD)

## What happened since the last report?

- Evaluated edge cases and fallback logic related to `sys_language_uid = -1` in DataHandler operations
- Discussed Lolli’s list of necessary adjustments for replacing `sys_language_uid = -1`, including synchronization behavior and content relations
- Discussed challenges and possible solutions related to `l10n_diffsource`
- Clarified separation between localization handling and generic data synchronization within DataHandler
- Considered how UI handling should reflect new translation workflows
- Outlined possible support for AI-based translation analysis and its implications
- Discussed whether the planned switch to language tag–based identification could address the current limitation that files uploaded via the filelist are not translatable
- Discussed how to phase the transition away from `sys_language_uid = -1` and how to prioritize implementation steps under limited development resources
- Identified undocumented fallback and synchronization behavior related to `sys_language_uid = -1`

## What will happen until the next report?

- Define concrete validation steps for replacing `sys_language_uid = -1` in production scenarios
- Consider consistent error handling patterns for potential failures during migration
- Continue discussions on synchronization logic between language variants
- Prepare a structured implementation plan based on strategic priorities

## Any scope changes?

- So far, nothing has changed here

## Need help?

- So far we do not need any further help

## Any last words?

- Regular meetings have helped to maintain focus despite resource limitations
