## Topic 1: Copy patch ist durch 

The copy-patch has been completed: [Issue](https://forge.typo3.org/issues/103828), [Patch](https://review.typo3.org/c/Packages/TYPO3.CMS/+/84237), [Commit](https://github.com/tYPO3/typo3/commit/d28f7b04d823142a59581019fe04c1d22cf6921e)

## Topic 2: Move Record patch

- [Issue](https://forge.typo3.org/issues/102345)
- Agreement on behaviour:
    - Soft-delete would be okay
    - Issue a warning: Attention translations x and y have been deleted. Recycle bin
- TODO:
    - Create sub-ticket for Move
    - Develop patch

## Topic 3: Locale

- The completely `locale` based output in TYPO3 v12 is not cool
- Entfernen der option `typo3Language` https://forge.typo3.org/issues/103887
- Entfernung `hreflang`
    * Kann abweichen, z.B. nur Sprache ohne Land
    * Anderer hreflang als verfügbare server Locale
- `locale` Fallback funktioniert nicht

## Topic 4: Language Identifier

- Currently integer (`sys_language_uid`)
    - Disadvantage: Integer IDs are in conflict across instances
- In future: String (BCP-47)
    - Advantage: Data can be shared across instances
- Should be able to be defined independently of the locale

## Topic 5: Patch Configurable Default language

Patch [84338: [WIP][FEATURE] Make default language uid configurable](https://review.typo3.org/c/Packages/TYPO3.CMS/+/84338) is good preliminary work that we will follow up on and try to package in TYPO3 v13, as we will not change anything for the time being.

## Topic 6: Locale

Astrid looks at local problems (Evaluation of the comma-separated list in the core code?)
