Eric has prepared a document based on the past minutes that records the current status of the initiative:

# Topic 2: Conversation with Lolli (Core Team) about configurable default language

According to Astrid, André has had a conversation with Lolli about our patch [84338: [WIP][FEATURE] Make default language uid configurable](https://review.typo3.org/c/Packages/TYPO3.CMS/+/84338) in the meantime. It turned out that there has only been one misunderstanding so far and that Lolli is in favour of this initiative.

In the meantime, Benni has replied in the patch. In principle, he rates the patch favourably, but sees major problems in terms of implementation.

As we do not have the resources in the team to complete this patch we would now like to resume talks with Soren Malling from the University of Copenhagen. Soren had offered us his support in this context. Ultimately, it needs to be clarified to what extent Soren is able to contribute development time and/or financial support. André could coordinate further work on the patch.

# Topic 3: Discussions on locales

According to Astrid's research, there is currently only one locale in the core code. This state seems to have been the case for some time. She finds it difficult to estimate how to bring back the functionality of a comma-separated list (locale fallback behaviour).

In her opinion, we should update the documentation in the current state.

Benni would like to move away completely from locales installed on the server in future. As far as we understand Benni, PHP-based internationalisation functions should be used in future (php-intl). This would enable custom locales such as en_DE without having to install them as locales on the server.

Until a corresponding change has been made, we would like to keep the obsolete Site Configuration properties `typo3Language` and `locale` in TYPO3 v13 as obsolete but retain their functionality.
