## Topic 1: Meeting Frequency and Focus

Eric opened the meeting by addressing the reduced need for weekly discussions and the increasing focus on development work. He suggested that, given limited volunteer time, the team might meet less frequently to allocate more time for implementing core patches and advancing technical tasks. Weekly meetings will continue for now to handle any questions, but the long-term schedule may change.

## Topic 2: TYPO3 v14 Updates and Workspace Issues

Eric reported testing TYPO3 v14 and encountering a deprecated `DataHandler` property that blocked execution. He temporarily commented it out, which allowed the testing extension to work. The team discussed removing the obsolete `bypassWorkspaceRestrictions` property from the extension. André confirmed that it can be safely removed, and Eric committed to pushing the change to `main`.

They concluded that the property’s removal has no adverse effect on their current workflow since Workspace functionality is not relevant for their testing scenario.

## Topic 3: Translation Handling Test Scenarios

Eric introduced a new **IRRE Test Content Element** to simulate parent-child relationships for translation testing. He demonstrated scenarios where parent and child elements have different `sys_language_uid` values, examining how TYPO3 handles translations in such cases. The group analyzed translation behavior under various conditions:

- **Parent and Child both `0`:** Translation results in both receiving the target language.
- **Parent `-1`, Child `0`:** The child element cannot be translated because the parent is global (`-1`).
- **Parent and Child language mismatch:** TYPO3 allows inconsistencies, which should ideally be prevented.

Steffen and Eric shared customer experiences where editors use shortcuts and mixed trees to bypass language consistency. They noted the frequent transition from multi-tree to single-tree setups, where such issues are common.

## Topic 4: Validation of IRRE Test Cases

With André joining the session, the team continued defining valid and invalid IRRE test scenarios:

Valid initial states include:
- Parent `0`, Child `0`
- Parent `-1`, Child `0`
- Parent `0`, Child `-1`
- Parent `-1`, Child `-1`

They agreed that mixed states like `Parent 0` with `Child 1` or cross-language relations are invalid for initial setups but can occur through editor actions.

The team discussed that these inconsistencies should be considered **bugs** rather than valid states. They plan to document them in core tests to clarify current versus desired behavior.

## Topic 5: Language Consistency and Core Behavior

Eric and André investigated how different operations—**translate**, **move**, **copy**, and **edit**—affect language consistency between parent and child records:

- **Translate / Copy:** Both parent and child correctly adopt the target language.
- **Move / Edit via Language Selector:** Only the parent changes language; the child remains unchanged.

They agreed that this inconsistency should be treated as a **core bug**. The expected behavior is that children inherit the language of their parent when the parent’s language changes.

André proposed creating a **Forge issue** describing these cases, comparing expected vs. actual outcomes. The goal is to initiate discussion with core maintainers such as Lolli and Benni to determine whether this inconsistency can be addressed in TYPO3 v14 or marked as deprecated for future correction.

## Topic 6: Discussion on M:N Relations and Future Scope

Toward the end, the team briefly discussed the added complexity of **M:N relations** and their translatability. Eric emphasized focusing first on IRRE relations before extending to M:N cases. They agreed that ensuring consistent language propagation across all relational types is the long-term objective but will proceed in incremental steps to avoid fragmentation.

The session ended with agreement to formalize observed cases and expected behavior in documentation and prepare a Forge issue for further evaluation in the core team.
