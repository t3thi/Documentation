## Topic 1: Review of Previous Findings and Context

Eric began the meeting by summarizing the outcomes of the previous session held on 2025-11-14 for Martin, who had not attended.  
He recapped the introduction of the **IRRE Test Content Element** used to examine parent-child relationships in translation handling.  
The earlier meeting had already established that TYPO3 currently permits language inconsistencies between parent and child elements—an issue classified as a **core bug**.

Eric reviewed the test cases already identified as valid and invalid in the last session, including:
- Valid: `Parent 0 / Child 0`, `Parent -1 / Child 0`, `Parent 0 / Child -1`, `Parent -1 / Child -1`
- Invalid: mixed-language constellations (e.g., `Parent 0 / Child 1`)

He also reiterated that operations like **translate** and **copy** correctly synchronize languages, while **move** and **edit** via the language selector cause inconsistencies.  
The focus of the current meeting was therefore to deepen the technical reasoning and formalize the rules derived from those earlier observations.

## Topic 2: Refinement of Language Synchronization Rules

Building on the previously identified inconsistencies, Eric and Martin discussed in more depth how TYPO3 should handle language propagation between parent and child elements.  
They agreed that the existing rules could be expressed more clearly and should form the basis for future core tests.

The refined rules were formulated as follows:

- **Condition 1:** The language of the parent element is not `-1`.
- **Condition 2:** The language of the child element is not `-1`.
- **Condition 3:** The language of the child element equals the language of the parent element.
- **Rule:** A change in the parent element’s language must update the child element’s language to match the parent.

---

- **Condition 1:** The language of the child element is `-1`.
- **Rule:** Changing the parent element’s language **must not** alter the child element’s language.

---

- **Condition 1:** The language of the child element is not `-1`.
- **Rule:** The language of the child element must always match that of the parent element.

---

- **Condition 1:** The language of the parent element is `-1`.
- **Condition 2:** The language of the child element is not `-1`.
- **Rule:** The child element may belong to a specific language while the parent is shared across all languages (`-1`).  
  This reflects a valid scenario where a globally shared parent contains localized children.

These formulations build directly on the previous meeting’s results but clarify the boundaries and relationships between parent and child elements.

## Topic 3: Inline Record Dependencies and Deletion Behavior

The conversation moved to how **inline (IRRE) records** behave when deleted or restored.  
Both agreed that inline children are integral parts of their parent elements, comparable to individual fields within a record. Therefore, deleting a parent must always delete its children.

They noted that TYPO3’s Recycler presents challenges when restoring records:
- Inline children without their parents should not appear as standalone items.
- Restoration should follow an “all or nothing” approach — either restoring a parent with all its children or none at all.
- Selective restoration per child would add unnecessary complexity and risk further inconsistencies.

This aligns with the general principle established earlier: **data integrity between parent and child records must always be preserved.**

## Topic 4: Consistency Within the Language Dimension

Eric revisited the conceptual background from earlier discussions on TYPO3’s **language as a dimension**.  
He explained again that language currently serves as the only dimension controlling content output and that, in the future, TYPO3 could benefit from multiple dimensions (e.g., language, country, or sales region).

Martin agreed with this perspective and pointed out that, while conceptually powerful, a multidimensional approach could increase cognitive complexity for editors.  
Both emphasized that, within the current single-dimension model, **cross-language inconsistencies must never occur**, except for the intentional use of `-1` for globally shared content.

## Topic 5: Edge Cases When Changing Parent Language

The discussion then turned to specific edge cases that arise when changing the language of a parent element—particularly when the parent was previously assigned `-1`.  
They reviewed various strategies that could theoretically be applied by TYPO3 when such changes occur:

1. **Delete** child records whose language no longer matches.
2. **Reset** child records to the parent’s new language.
3. **Create translated parent records** and reassign existing children accordingly.

The pair agreed that a pragmatic approach would be preferable:
- Orphaned children (those losing their valid parent) should remain visible but clearly marked (for instance, highlighted in yellow).
- Editors should then decide whether to delete, reassign, or translate affected records manually.

This approach aims to preserve transparency and editorial control while preventing silent data corruption.

## Topic 6: Transition From `-1` to a New Synchronization Mechanism

Finally, Eric outlined the next development step already planned in prior meetings: replacing the special `-1` mechanism with a structured synchronization model.  
Initially, this will rely on a boolean flag (`isLanguageAllRecord`) to indicate global synchronization across all languages.  
In later iterations, this flag could evolve into a **selectable synchronization group**, allowing specific sets of languages to share synchronized records.

This staged migration strategy ensures backward compatibility while allowing TYPO3 to progress toward a more robust, predictable translation handling system.

## Topic 7: Outlook

The meeting concluded with Eric noting that Martin would not be available for the next session due to a client workshop.  
Both agreed that the clarified rule set and edge-case analysis would serve as a stable foundation for the upcoming technical documentation and automated test definitions.
