## Topic 1: Progress on extension compatibility

The team briefly discussed the current status of the T3THI extension. Martin mentioned that he had planned to download and install the extension this week but had not yet managed to do so. He asked whether TYPO3 v13 was sufficient or whether v14 was required. It was confirmed that v12 is no longer supported, but the functionality is available in v13 and v14-dev.

It was confirmed that the extension currently requires dependency adjustments to be compatible with TYPO3 v12. Eric has already started working on these updates.

## Topic 2: Review and automation of deployment (Off-topic)

André presented his progress in setting up automated review environments. For each merge request, a dedicated review instance is now automatically created and deleted once the request has been merged.

He explained that the instance is generated under a unique subdomain based on the merge request ID and protected with basic authentication. Although each subdomain requires re-authentication, this setup allows developers and project managers to easily preview changes. Updates to merge requests trigger an automatic update of the corresponding review instances.

## Topic 3: Scheduling and daily automation (Off-topic)

Martin and Eric discussed possible automations for recurring tasks such as database synchronization or update runs. They considered scheduling nightly and daily jobs to detect issues earlier, rather than being confronted with problems just before deployment. Eric emphasized the benefit of regular automation:

> “I like the idea of running it daily—otherwise, things pile up for three weeks and everything breaks the day before we go live.”

This proactive approach would ensure smoother operations and early detection of integration issues.

## Topic 4: Short meeting with time for questions

The team used the remaining time to make progress on the planned tasks. The team members remained in the meeting room for the rest of the time but were muted so they could respond to questions from other participants.

A new IRRE content element was created to test the link to sub-records. The implementation mirrors the configuration used by content blocks, but the group made a conscious decision not to use content blocks in order to focus on pure core functionality. This approach allows for better isolation of test scenarios related to translation handling and data relationships.
