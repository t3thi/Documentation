## Topic 1: Adjusting Meeting Rhythm and Team Focus

Eric and André discussed the current meeting frequency and agreed that weekly meetings consume too much time given the small team size. Eric proposed shifting to a monthly schedule to allow more focused coding and testing between sessions. Both agreed that asynchronous collaboration should remain open for ad-hoc questions and coordination.

Eric also suggested that the team should pause regular meetings during December to give everyone time to recharge and work independently on their contributions if desired.

## Topic 2: Test Extension and Development Strategy

André reported on his exploration of an event-based approach for the test extension but concluded that it would be too time-consuming with little added benefit. They decided to keep the test extension simple and use it as a stable foundation for further testing.

They agreed that future efforts should prioritize core contributions, particularly addressing the handling of `language = -1` and preparing sustainable patches that improve TYPO3’s core localization logic.

## Topic 3: Preparing a Core Work-in-Progress Patch

Eric outlined his plan to create a **Work-in-Progress Core Patch** to identify and annotate all relevant TYPO3 core files impacted by language handling changes. He aims to map areas such as `TCA`, `PageRepository`, `LanguageAspect`, Extbase, and backend user rights.

The patch will include comments like `TODO: Language All Clean-Up` to mark affected areas and serve as a base for later code updates. André agreed that this dual-track approach — refining tests and mapping affected areas — will make future refactoring more manageable.

## Topic 4: Redefining Language Synchronization Logic

Eric and André examined scenarios involving parent-child record synchronization and `language = -1` usage. They discussed how to ensure consistent synchronization rules, such as enforcing that a child record always inherits its parent’s language when appropriate.

They agreed that:
- The child’s language should automatically update when the parent’s language changes (unless the parent uses `language = -1`).
- The field for selecting a child’s language might be disabled or hidden in the backend when not relevant.
- Implementation should first focus on correctness at the data level, followed by UI refinements.

## Topic 5: Replacing `language = -1` with a Configurable Field

The team revisited the idea of replacing the `language = -1` mechanism with a new configurable field `language_sync`, tentatively named under TCA key `ctrl.languageSyncField`. Eric proposed introducing this field on default records as a boolean (`0/1`) to indicate whether synchronization across languages should occur.

In the future, this could evolve into a multi-select field to specify target languages. For now, they agreed to implement it only for default language records and later extend its flexibility once the foundation is proven stable.

## Topic 6: Handling of Orphaned and Synchronized Records

They analyzed how toggling synchronization could create orphaned records or redundant data. Eric and André explored potential cleanup mechanisms to prevent data duplication when switching between synchronization states.

They discussed whether orphaned records should be soft-deleted or retained for reactivation and agreed that soft deletion (`deleted = 1`) with controlled restoration would be safer. They also noted the need to prevent exponential record creation when toggling states repeatedly.

## Topic 7: Identified Bug in Translation Handling

During live testing, Eric and André discovered that when a default record with translations is switched to `language = -1`, the existing translations remain in the database but become invalid, causing inconsistencies in the “Language Comparison” submodule of the "Layout" (formerly "Page") module.

They decided to create a Forge ticket ([Task #108358](https://forge.typo3.org/issues/108358)) to address this issue, proposing the following improvement:

> **Title:** Display warning for orphaned content elements when `l10n_parent` refers to a record with `language = -1`

The planned fix includes:
- A visual warning for editors when such orphaned translations exist.
- Highlighting affected records similarly to how “Mixed Mode” inconsistencies are displayed.
- Applying this to both the Page module and Record editing view.

## Topic 8: Ticket Assignment and Implementation

Eric drafted the Forge issue text, while André offered to take ownership of the ticket and implement the warning feature. They discussed possible implementation details such as using existing CSS/JS from the Mixed Mode warnings for consistency.

They agreed that the warning would display in the Page module and that connected records should remain marked as “Connected” rather than “Mixed Mode” for clarity.

## Topic 9: Closing Remarks and Winter Break

The meeting concluded with both agreeing to enter a **December winter break** from regular meetings. Contributions can continue asynchronously. Eric and André exchanged holiday wishes and expressed hope for a calmer period to regain focus and balance between projects and open-source work.
