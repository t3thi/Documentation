## Topic 1: Recap of Previous Findings

Eric summarized the outcomes of the last meeting (2025-11-14) for Martin.  
The IRRE Test Content Element and earlier test cases were reviewed to confirm understanding:

- Valid: `Parent 0 / Child 0`, `Parent -1 / Child 0`, `Parent 0 / Child -1`, `Parent -1 / Child -1`
- Invalid: mixed-language combinations (e.g., `Parent 0 / Child 1`)

The already known issue—that TYPO3 allows language mismatches between parent and child elements—was reaffirmed.  
This inconsistency remains the main focus for further clarification and testing.

## Topic 2: Consolidation of Language Synchronization Rules

Eric and Martin refined the rules discussed previously to define consistent language propagation in IRRE relations:

- **Condition 1:** Parent language ≠ `-1`
- **Condition 2:** Child language ≠ `-1`
- **Condition 3:** Child language = Parent language
- **Rule:** Changing the parent’s language updates the child’s language accordingly.

---

- **Condition:** Child language = `-1`
- **Rule:** Changing the parent’s language does **not** affect the child.

---

- **Condition:** Parent language = `-1`, Child language ≠ `-1`
- **Rule:** The child may belong to a specific language while the parent is shared across all languages.

These definitions build directly on the previous session and serve as the base for future core tests.

## Topic 3: Inline Record and Deletion Behavior

They confirmed that inline (IRRE) children are integral parts of their parent records.  
Deleting a parent must also delete its children. In the Recycler, standalone child records should not appear.  
Restoration should be all-or-nothing to prevent inconsistent states.

## Topic 4: Language as a Dimension

Eric restated that “language” currently acts as TYPO3’s only dimension controlling content output.  
Both agreed that this must remain internally consistent — children may never belong to a different specific language than their parent, except in `-1` cases.  
Extending the concept to multiple dimensions (e.g., language + country) remains a long-term idea.

## Topic 5: Edge Cases When Changing Parent Language

They reviewed how TYPO3 should behave when a parent’s language changes, especially from `-1` to a specific language.  
Possible reactions include deleting, resetting, or reassigning children.  
Preferred approach:
- Keep orphaned children visible (e.g., highlighted).
- Let editors decide whether to delete, reassign, or translate.

## Topic 6: Replacement of the `-1` Mechanism

Eric outlined the planned transition from the special `-1` handling to a synchronization model using a boolean flag (`isLanguageAllRecord`).  
Later this may allow defining synchronization groups across specific languages.  
The change will be introduced gradually to maintain compatibility.

## Topic 7: Outlook

Martin will miss the next meeting due to a client workshop.
