## Topic 1: Reactivating the Translation Handling Extension

Eric initiated a discussion about the outdated Translation Handling Extension they had built for testing purposes. He confirmed that it works on TYPO3 v13 with updated Composer dependencies and tried running it on v14-dev, which revealed some site configuration issues. The team agreed it would be useful to revive the extension to support testing scenarios involving parent-child relations, `-1` languages, and language overlays.

André suggested using it as a visual verification layer to complement core CSV-based tests. The team found this helpful to simplify the understanding of scenarios and to be able to interact with them via the TYPO3 backend and frontend, rather than relying solely on abstract test definitions.

They discussed aligning the extension directly with TYPO3 core functionality, including the use of internal classes, as their goal is to test and improve core behavior. Supporting older versions (e.g., v12) was deemed unnecessary, so they decided to maintain compatibility only with the current main version.

## Topic 2: Version Branching Strategy for the Extension

Eric and André discussed how to handle versioning in the extension's Git repository. They agreed to maintain a `main` branch that always reflects the latest TYPO3 version compatibility, alongside branches like `12` or `13` for legacy code states. Tags were considered unnecessary to avoid any accidental usage via `composer require`.

The team created a `12` branch to represent the last known working state for TYPO3 v12 and continued making updates in `main` for v14. Adjustments were made to the `ext_emconf.php` and `composer.json` to ensure compatibility with TYPO3 v14.

## Topic 3: Test Setup and Inline Relations

Eric demonstrated a simplified test extension with an inline relation between a parent element and child elements containing only a title and language field. This was used to test how different language configurations behave with IRRE (inline relational record editing) elements in various scenarios:

- A parent in `language=0` with children in `language=0`, `-1`, or `1`.
- A parent in `language=-1` with similar child combinations.
- A translated parent in `language=1` with its own children.
- Behavior of these structures in frontend rendering and backend module views.

The setup included the use of `FluidStyledContent`, `TypoScript`, and a minimal `SiteConfiguration` with `SiteSets`. The team validated the rendering behavior by creating a minimal content structure and observing how TYPO3 resolves and displays IRRE children under different conditions.

A key observation was that:

- **All IRRE children were rendered regardless of their language setting**, even when the page was requested in a different language. For example, children with `language=1` appeared when viewing the page in `language=0`, and vice versa.
- This behavior was consistent across all tested parent-child language combinations, including parents in `language=-1`.
- The output was not filtered according to the current language context of the page, which contradicted the team's expectations.

To verify behavior across translation modes, a translated version of the page was created in the backend using **Connected Mode**. The structure consisted of:

- An original page in `language=0`.
- A translated version of the same page in `language=1`.
- Content elements representing:
    - A default-language parent with IRRE children.
    - A translated parent with its own IRRE children.
    - A `language=-1` parent shared across languages, also with IRRE children.

Despite the differing parent language configurations, **all child records were rendered on both language versions of the page**, regardless of their individual language setting.

The team concluded that this behavior requires further structured testing to determine whether it is consistent with TYPO3’s intended logic for language overlays and IRRE resolution. Special attention should be given to how TYPO3 resolves IRRE children in relation to the current page language and the parent’s language configuration.

## Topic 4: Preparing a Reproducible Test Scenario

The team decided to document the different IRRE configurations they had tested and include them in the translation handling extension as reproducible scenarios. These would serve as consistent test cases for both backend and frontend behavior analysis. Key variations include:

- Parents with `language=0`, `-1`, or `1`, each containing children with various language settings.
- Translations of these structures in connected and free mode.
- Edge cases such as mixed language nesting (`0 -> -1 -> 0`).

They discussed integrating these into the test generator logic and extending the current `generate` command to create representative pages and content elements automatically.

## Topic 5: Next Steps for Extension Enhancement

Eric offered to zip up the current test extension setup and attach it to an issue for further use. André suggested extracting the relevant `TCA` and TypoScript configuration from Eric’s test setup to reuse within the official test extension.

The goal is to expand the coverage by adding deeply nested IRRE structures in multiple language combinations to allow flexible and realistic testing of TYPO3’s translation handling in complex scenarios.
