## Topic 1: Need for Practical Core Work

Eric explained that the team realized during the Developer Days that continuous conceptual refinement is not sustainable without moving into actual core development. Even Lolli admitted that he cannot foresee all future steps. Thus, the initiative concluded it cannot wait for a fully detailed concept before beginning implementation.

The team agreed on a dual-track approach:
- One group works directly on core patches.
- Another continues conceptual work to support development.

Lolli expressed strong interest in working with Astrid and André due to their past contributions and development quality. This two-track method allows flexibility while enabling progress.

## Topic 2: Handling of `-1` in Language Synchronization

The discussion focused on eliminating the use of `-1` in language handling and replacing it with a more structured synchronization model.

The following points were addressed:

- The team suggested starting synchronization logic at the field level and extending it to record level.
- They proposed evaluating whether a new `Enforced-Language-Synchronization` mechanism could replace `l10n_mode=exclude`.
- The three current `l10n_mode` values (`prefixLangTitle`, `exclude`, and default) would be analyzed to determine if they can be replaced.
- The distinction between system fields and translation-relevant fields must be carefully considered, particularly depending on context (e.g. free vs. connected mode).

Eric pointed out that toggle actions (sync on/off) should include warnings only when actual data loss could occur. The toggle mechanism must be smart enough to detect potential issues before applying synchronization changes.

## Topic 3: Complex Parent/Child Scenarios

The team explored edge cases involving record relationships, such as:

- Parents with multiple children across different languages and synchronization states.
- Inconsistent language assignments (e.g. parent with `-1` and child with `0`, or vice versa).
- Inline elements and M:N relations (e.g. blog tags) that refer across records and languages.

André and Eric discussed various logic flows, such as:
- A `-1` parent implies full cross-language display, regardless of child languages.
- A `0` parent with `-1` children raises synchronization challenges, especially if the parent is not translated.
- Inline elements might need custom logic depending on parent availability in the target language.

The proposal was to implement clear rules:
- A `-1` child should only be synchronized to languages where the parent exists.
- A `-1` parent implies automatic synchronization of its children across all languages.

These cases should be formalized in test scenarios to validate assumptions and ensure safe transitions.

## Topic 4: Long-Term Goal of Replacing `-1` and `0` Identifiers

Eric reiterated the long-term vision of removing both `-1` and `0` as language identifiers in favor of using BCP 47-compliant language tags. This would enhance clarity and interoperability across systems.

In the short term, however, the focus remains on resolving the technical and conceptual issues around `-1`, including:

- Clarifying behavior of nested language configurations.
- Ensuring that editor workflows remain intuitive and safe.
- Identifying pre-patches that may be necessary to support cleaner synchronization logic.

Testing and structured modeling of edge cases will be essential in achieving this transition.
