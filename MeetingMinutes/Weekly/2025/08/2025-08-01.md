## Topic 1: Document Structure for Goals and Measures

Eric introduced the session with a reflection on recent Developer Days and the workload leading up to them. He highlighted the need to continue shaping the initiative’s documentation, particularly the conceptual structure around goals and measures. A previously drafted document had been reopened for this purpose, and Eric shared the link in the Slack Huddle.

The discussion focused on defining a clear and maintainable structure for documenting the current situation (`Ist-Zustand`), identified problems, and the resulting goals and measures. Jo emphasized that it is essential to strictly separate the different layers:

- **Ist-Zustand**: Describes the current state, both positive and negative aspects.
- **Conflicts**: Highlights where contradictions and tensions arise from the current setup.
- **Goals**: Derived from the analysis of the Ist-Zustand and conflicts, including what should be preserved and what should be improved.
- **Measures**: Specific steps proposed to reach the defined goals.

Jo pointed out that measures must remain independent from goals in terms of formulation. Goals must not describe how something should be solved — only *what* should be achieved. This clarity enables flexibility in choosing or adjusting the technical path later.

Eric and Jo further developed a model in which:
- Conflicts may arise between good and bad aspects of the current system.
- Goals are formed through a structured assessment of the situation and conflicts.
- Some goals and measures are dependent on others and must be implemented in a specific order.
- The document must remain a "living document" to adapt to changing realities during development.

## Topic 2: Example Goals and Conflicts

The team developed a concrete example to illustrate the distinction between goals, conflicts, and measures:

### Goals:
- Ensure languages are uniquely and system-wide identifiable.
- Enable automatic propagation of changes across target languages.
- Enforce strict identity of certain records across multiple target languages.

### Conflict:
Currently, the third goal is achieved via the use of `language -1`, which directly contradicts the first goal. This conflict must be resolved.

### Measure:
As a result, one proposed measure is the removal of `language -1`.

This example demonstrated the importance of clearly separating goals from the means to achieve them.

## Topic 3: Introduction and Hierarchical Dependencies

The need for an introductory chapter in the document was discussed. It should define the purpose of the document and clarify that:

- There may be dependencies between goals and between measures.
- A defined sequence of implementation may be required.
- These dependencies and sequences may evolve over time, and the document must reflect those changes.

Eric and Jo aligned on using concepts from agile methodologies to define a structure resembling:

- **Epic** → represents the Ist-Zustand and related conflicts.
- **Stories** → represent specific goals derived from the Epic.
- **Tasks** → represent the measures required to implement the Stories.

The team concluded that maintaining this abstraction level, while keeping clarity and separation between components, will enable effective collaboration and documentation within the initiative.
