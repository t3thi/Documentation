## Topic 1: Concept Creation and Developer Days Insights

Eric and Jo reflected on the challenges surrounding the creation and justification of the Translation Handling concept. They emphasized the importance of concept work as a foundation for future patches and funding applications.

Eric described a recent influential conversation with Lolli at the DevDays, where they discussed the importance of the `DataHandler` for translation features. Lolli encouraged them to contribute code directly rather than spending extensive time defining a complete concept upfront.

While Lolli advocated for an iterative, action-first approach without fully defined goals, Eric and Jo agreed that it’s important to articulate the "why" behind each technical change.

They concluded that a parallel approach would be more sensible. Some members of the initiative who have already developed patches for specific translation handling tasks, such as Astrid and André, could immediately begin implementing improvements that are already well understood (e.g., eliminating the use of “-1”), while other team members refine the concept and clarify its rationale.

## Topic 2: Removing `-1` and Introducing Synchronization

The team agreed that the current approach using `-1` for language synchronization is problematic and must be replaced. They outlined a plan for an enforced synchronization system:

- Introduce a boolean flag to mark records for synchronization across all languages.
- Synchronization should be enforced, not optional.
- The behavior should apply to **translatable fields only**, not system-level fields like `sorting` or `colPos`.
- In `connected` mode, synchronization should include positioning and structure.
- In `free` mode, structure should remain independent to allow flexibility.

They also discussed how to ensure a proper migration from `-1`:

- All affected records will be migrated using the new system.
- The `Enforce Language Synchronization` behavior will replace current mechanisms like `L10n_mode = exclude` and the existing `Allow Language Synchronization`.
- UI elements will warn editors when toggling this flag due to its irreversible effects.

## Topic 3: Clarification of the concept of free mode and its impact on language synchronization

This was followed by a discussion about the nature of “free” mode and its impact on synchronization. The most important considerations included:

- In “free” mode, editors should be able to overwrite and extend the content structure, including subordinate data sets such as images.
- Nevertheless, forced synchronization continues to apply to all content within a data set. This also includes the relational structure. Deviating images, for example, are not provided for in synchronization targets (output behavior as for language -1).
- The team agreed to create a list of all system and translatable fields to clearly define the necessary enforcement logic. In particular, system fields that should be included in synchronization depending on the context can thus be clearly identified.

## Topic 4: Iterative Concept and Justification Strategy

The group agreed to break the overall concept into the smallest meaningful units:

- Define goals independently from actions.
- Link measures to clearly explained goals and conflicts in the current system.
- Examples:
    - Goal: Languages must be uniquely identifiable across systems.
    - Conflict: This is incompatible with using `-1`.
    - Measure: Remove `-1` in favor of a defined synchronization mechanism.

Rather than waiting for a full concept to be completed, the team will document and justify steps retrospectively, allowing development and conceptual work to proceed in parallel.
