## Topic 1: DevDays Participation and Talks

The team briefly discussed the upcoming DevDays. Eric confirmed his attendance, and Astrid will also participate. André mentioned that he submitted a talk, which has been accepted. His talk will focus on DDEV tips and tricks, including environment variable management and installing Dev Addons more easily. They also discussed the possibility of Jo attending, as he usually does, and noted that they might see Sven as well.

## Topic 2: Reflections on the Concept Document Created by Olivier

The team took time to reflect on the current state of the concept document that Olivier has been developing with the support of Claude AI. It was acknowledged that Olivier has invested a significant amount of effort into compiling and presenting the material, and that his proactive work has helped bring the topic of Translation Handling more prominently into the TYPO3 community.

At the same time, concerns were expressed about the accuracy and reliability of AI-generated content, especially when the goal is to submit a polished and representative document to the community. André noted that several sections require careful human review and validation, as certain details appeared either outdated, factually incorrect, or not fully aligned with the current reality of the initiative's work.

It was assumed — though not with complete certainty — that Astrid's contributed chapter may be the only section created entirely through manual effort. This chapter, which involved significant editorial work, is seen as a strong and well-founded contribution that could serve as a basis for the initiative’s own further developments.

Eric and Astrid emphasized that while AI can be a helpful drafting tool, the final output must always be reviewed, edited, and validated by subject matter experts — especially when the initiative’s name and credibility are associated with the result.

The team agreed that, in its current form, the document cannot be endorsed or published under the initiative’s name. However, this position is not intended to diminish Olivier’s valuable contributions or his ongoing advocacy for the topic. His communication efforts and visibility around Translation Handling have helped bring awareness to the broader community, which the group appreciates.

## Topic 3: Decision on Further Collaboration with Olivier’s Repository

Given the upcoming deadline and the maturity of the current draft, the team discussed how best to move forward. While the initiative is currently not in a position to formally contribute corrections or enhancements to the repository as it stands, it was agreed that future collaboration remains possible — provided that the content undergoes a preliminary review by Olivier himself and is brought to a level where it reflects consistent and validated messaging.

Eric suggested that if a substantial revision is not feasible within the given timeframe, the initiative might consider starting fresh with its own outline and validated content. However, this would not prevent Olivier from continuing his efforts independently, which could still yield useful insights or input in the future.

## Topic 4: Technical Discussion – Handling of Translated Records in Extbase

André presented a practical issue with translated records in a TYPO3 Extbase context. He described a problem where default language records remained referenced after translation, leading to frontend crashes when a translation was missing.

The team explored various technical strategies:
- Using `findByUID` and adding language validation manually.
- Switching to `findOneBy` with awareness of its behavior depending on QuerySettings.
- Implementing a fallback to language overlay manually using `PageRepository::getLanguageOverlay`.
- Avoiding `findOneBy` in favor of custom queries for better control.

Astrid suggested that directly querying and applying overlays using TYPO3’s core methods ensures clarity and correctness. André agreed that relying solely on Extbase’s inconsistent behavior can lead to unexpected issues.

The team discussed potential improvements in the TYPO3 core, including better handling of overlays and more predictable behavior in query methods. They recognized that Extbase was originally designed to abstract translation handling, but practical use cases often demand more control and predictability.

Eric and André both noted that current behaviors feel inconsistent and require workarounds. Astrid concluded that building queries manually may be the most reliable approach in complex scenarios.
