## Topic 1: Structural Redefinition of the Translation Concept

Eric explained the current goal of developing a comprehensive concept for TYPO3 translation handling. This initiative seeks to replace previously AI-generated content and fragmented structural documentation with a team-driven approach that ensures consistency and relevance. While past contributions from Olivier and Astrid will be considered, the core concept should originate from the team itself.

The concept must be suitable for integration into the strategic process and future patch workflows and should address open questions, not just finished solutions. A Google Doc was introduced to collaboratively capture the team’s thoughts.

## Topic 2: Survey vs. Concept Priority

Astrid inquired whether the plan was to continue running a survey parallel to the concept creation. Eric clarified that while the survey is useful, the priority lies with concept development. Jo added that a survey should serve as a tool to validate the concept, not to replace foundational thinking. The group agreed that personas and surveys should only be addressed after establishing conceptual substance.

## Topic 3: Initial Goal Definitions and Brainstorming

Eric and Jo began to structure a list of high-level goals, starting with the overarching aim of reducing the complexity of how translation data is stored and rendered. Astrid emphasized that many of the current problems (e.g. overlays, default language behavior, numerical identifiers) have already been documented in the "Current State" document.

The following key goals were identified and structured:

- The way translation data is stored and rendered should be reduced to the essential minimum.
- Numerical identifiers for languages should be replaced by standardized identifiers, such as BCP47.
    - The special identifier `-1` ("All languages") must be removed.
- Overlaying should be eliminated.
    - As a result, translation layers in the database must be completed.
- The concept of Connected and Free Mode in the Page Module should be resolved.
    - This includes:
        - Synchronizing `sorting` and `colPos` (EnforceLanguageSynchronization) as an alternative to Connected Mode.
        - Ensuring Free Mode can work without Translation Parent relationships.
        - Unifying behavior between backend editing and frontend output (Site Configuration).

## Topic 4: Approaches to Connected and Free Mode Resolution

Two conceptual approaches to resolve Connected and Free Mode were discussed:

1. **Default Language as Invisible Structure Layer:**
   The default language would be retained solely as a structure-defining but contentless layer. All content elements would reference this structure but would contain content only in individual languages.

2. **Redundant Structural Information in All Languages:**
   Structure information would be duplicated across all languages. Shadow Records (invisible records) could represent elements not meant to be visible in certain languages, enabling full structural representation while retaining editorial flexibility.

Jo emphasized the importance of retaining the ability to handle legal or regional constraints (e.g. showing or hiding specific content in certain locales). Anja and Eric supported a model where each language carries sufficient structural information, with optional visibility toggles for each language.

## Topic 5: Eliminating the Concept of Default Language

Anja raised the idea of eliminating the concept of a default language altogether, proposing that all languages be treated as equal. In this model, when a content element is created in any language, corresponding placeholders (e.g. invisible elements) would automatically be created in other languages. Editors could then decide which versions to activate or make visible.

This would prevent the need for blank records in a "default" language and remove the ambiguity of which language is "leading" the structure.

Jo countered with a performance-oriented consideration: redundant data in all languages could become inefficient, especially at scale. Instead, a structure-only layer might be more efficient, avoiding unnecessary content duplication.

## Topic 6: Technical Considerations and Redundancy Tradeoffs

The group discussed the trade-offs between redundant structures and centralized structural layers. While full redundancy ensures each language is structurally complete, it may introduce inefficiencies. A central structure layer would minimize redundancy but require careful mapping.

The discussion also covered Fallback behavior, synchronization timing, and placeholder visibility for editors. Ultimately, the team acknowledged the importance of exploring multiple approaches before committing to a solution.

## Topic 7: Clarifying Requirements for Structural Consistency

Toward the end of the meeting, the group focused on the necessity of structural consistency:

- Regardless of the selected approach, each content element must have a structural reference to maintain sorting and layout.
- Even if a content element is not shown in a specific language, its structural placeholder must exist to support synchronization.
- Both proposed models (redundant structures and centralized structure layer) require complete structural information, either distributed or abstracted.

Eric summarized that achieving seamless interchangeability between Connected and Free Mode behavior depends on maintaining this structural consistency.
