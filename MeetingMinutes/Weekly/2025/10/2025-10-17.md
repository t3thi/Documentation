## Topic 1: Team Availability and Focus

Eric reported that Astrid would not be available until the end of the year due to personal reasons. The team acknowledged this and discussed the implications for the upcoming months. Eric noted that the year was quickly passing and that they should stay focused on achievable short-term goals.

## Topic 2: Refactoring Versus Immediate Core Work

Eric and André discussed whether the translation handling testing extension’s event-based architecture should be refactored now or postponed. Given the limited developer capacity, both agreed that the event-based redesign is desirable for the future but should not be pursued at this stage. Instead, the practical and immediate priority is to work with the current extension codebase and move toward concrete fixes and patches for the `-1` content handling in the TYPO3 Core.

## Topic 3: Implementing `-1` Content Scenarios

The discussion then shifted to how `-1` content elements should be integrated into the extension. Eric proposed starting by creating and testing content elements with `sys_language_uid = -1`. These elements would later serve as test cases for Core behavior. Both agreed to begin with basic scenarios—first creating `-1` elements without child relations, followed by elements that include children. Once these setups are working, they will extend the testing to Core test cases.

## Topic 4: Purpose and Scope of the Test Extension

Eric emphasized that the Translation Handling Extension should primarily provide a solid base for GUI testing, not replicate all Core test cases. The team agreed that maintaining simplicity would help conserve effort. The extension should generate usable base scenarios that can be easily tested and then translated into automated Core tests.

## Topic 5: Technical Discussion on Content Generation and Language Handling

Eric and André examined the code related to content generation, especially around the handling of languages and excluded language lists. They discussed scenarios involving `excludeLanguages` and fallback configurations, ensuring that certain languages would not be automatically translated. Eric clarified that the current setup was designed specifically to test fallback behaviors.

They identified inconsistencies in how languages were being enumerated and planned to simplify this logic. Eric also suggested reintroducing an `All` option to streamline the exclusion handling.

## Topic 6: Future Development Approach

The conversation moved on to a broader discussion about the architecture of the translation handling testing extension. Eric proposed implementing a cleaner event-based model for content creation using objects to represent content elements (e.g., `ContentModelText`, `ContentModelTextMedia`). These would share a common interface with methods like `toArray()`, `get()`, and `set()` to standardize interactions with TYPO3’s DataHandler.

They agreed that `excludeLanguages` should be treated as an event-level property rather than stored directly in the content object. This would keep the model logic clean and modular.

## Topic 7: Upcoming Tasks and Next Steps

Eric planned to:
- Set up a feature branch for “Language-All Content” elements.
- Implement the first version of the content model and event-based structure.
- Prepare test cases for Core once the `-1` content setup is stable.

André agreed to continue refining the event-dispatching logic and to review how events trigger and interact (e.g., `CreateTranslationHandlingScenarioEvent`, `PageCreationEvent`, `ContentCreationEvent`).

Both concluded that the extension should target TYPO3 v13 and newer, leaving backward compatibility aside. They decided to revisit the event structure in the next meeting once the new model and event concepts have been drafted.
