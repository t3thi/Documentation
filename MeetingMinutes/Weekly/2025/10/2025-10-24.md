## Topic 1: Review of Translation Fields in the TYPO3 Core

Eric and Jo reviewed the translation fields currently used in the TYPO3 Core and discussed their relevance for the Translation Handling Initiative. They confirmed that `languageField`, `transOrigPointerField`, `translationSource`, and `transOrigDiffSourceField` are necessary for translation handling. Eric noted that certain pass-through fields would normally be removed by the Core if they are not explicitly defined in the `ext_tables.sql`.

The group also examined whether the field `origUid` remains relevant. Jo pointed out that the TYPO3 documentation still lists this field in version 13, while Eric mentioned that it appears to have been removed in practice. They agreed that the documentation and the Core might be inconsistent at this point.

## Topic 2: The Role of `origUid` and Its Deprecation

The conversation focused on the historic role of `origUid` in identifying the original record from which a copy or translation was created. Jo emphasized that the person who removed the field did not understand its purpose:

> "The `origUid` tells you the original record from which a copy was created — regardless of whether that copy was made by duplication or translation."

He explained that the field helped distinguish between the origin of a copied element and the source of its content, represented by `translationSource`. Without `origUid`, TYPO3 lost the ability to determine where a record originally came from if it wasn’t part of a connected translation structure.

Eric noted that in upgrade projects, it can be observed that “origUid” is routinely removed from all tables. André found evidence that the field has been largely removed except for certain inline relationship scenarios.

## Topic 3: Synchronization and Connected vs. Free Modes

The discussion moved to synchronization logic and the difference between connected and free translation modes. Jo explained that in the connected mode, every record has a defined parent (`transOrigPointerField`), which makes `origUid` unnecessary. In the free mode, however, this relationship may not exist, making the field still relevant.

Eric and Jo discussed whether TYPO3’s future model should continue supporting a true free mode or shift entirely toward a “technically connected” model. Jo argued that even if a “free” mode remains available for editors, the system could still maintain internal connections.

Eric summarized that if TYPO3 always maintains these internal links—via either shadow records or a structural layer—then `origUid` would become obsolete.

## Topic 4: Shadow Records vs. Structural Layer Approach

The team explored two architectural solutions for representing translation relationships:

1. **Shadow Record Approach:**  
   Each language maintains its full structure, with shadow records representing corresponding positions in other languages.  
   Jo pointed out that this approach leads to massive data duplication and complex synchronization issues.

2. **Structural Layer Approach:**  
   A shared, language-independent structural layer defines the content hierarchy. Each language record then references that layer, reducing redundancy and simplifying synchronization.

Jo favored the structural layer model, describing it as more efficient and conceptually aligned with TYPO3’s existing default language mechanism. He explained that the Core already effectively treats the default language as a structural control layer; the proposal would formalize and generalize that concept.

## Topic 5: Content Synchronization Logic

Eric and Jo clarified how content synchronization would work under the structural layer model.
- `transOrigPointerField` would point to the structure record (which is contentless).
- `translationSource` would point to the record providing the actual translatable content.

Jo highlighted that this distinction is crucial and often misunderstood — `transOrigPointerField` defines structure, while `translationSource` defines the content origin.

They agreed that this separation would make translation synchronization and language-agnostic content propagation more precise, especially for elements like addresses that should remain identical across all languages.

## Topic 6: Database and Migration Implications

The group discussed database implications of both approaches. Eric noted that a structural layer would require less data duplication and fewer database records than the shadow record model. Jo added that the structural approach would also make migration from existing TYPO3 setups easier, as it would only require converting parent relationships into references to structural records.

Martin found this explanation easier to follow and confirmed that the structural approach seemed more intuitive and maintainable from an integrator’s perspective.

## Topic 7: Closing Discussion

Eric summarized that both the shadow record and structural layer concepts have pros and cons, but the structural layer appears more efficient and future-proof. He emphasized the need for clear synchronization mechanisms and potential merging processes if shadow records were used.

Jo warned that shadow records could introduce heavy data overhead and additional complexity, especially when combined with TYPO3 Workspaces. The team agreed that the structural layer model aligns better with current Core behavior and will likely serve as the foundation for future translation handling.

Eric thanked everyone for participating and confirmed the next meeting would continue the topic of synchronization and translation structure refinement.
