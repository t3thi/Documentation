## Topic 1: Organizational tasks and format of meetings

Eric mentioned that he was behind schedule in writing the monthly meeting minutes and confirmed that he would like to submit them as soon as possible. He explained that he needed to update his AI-based pipeline in order to be able to produce proper reports again.

He reflected that the last few months had been conceptually challenging for the initiative and noted that the team had lost some contributors. For this reason, he had prioritized programming over documentation, which had led to delays in producing official reports. Eric suggested occasionally using the meetings for practical work sessions rather than purely for discussion, as the volunteers' available time was limited.

## Topic 2: Technical Issues with Recent TYPO3 Updates (Off-Topic)

André shared a recent problem he encountered with TYPO3 Core version 13.4.19. A change in the CSP (Content Security Policy) header behavior caused nonces not to be generated for some pages, resulting in broken JavaScript execution. He had temporarily downgraded to version 13.4.18 to restore stability.

Eric asked about possible patches, but André explained that patching was impractical for the project setup, so a downgrade was the simpler solution.

They also discussed deprecation notices in third-party extensions. Eric mentioned submitting several PRs to fix these issues and encouraged others to contribute similar patches to the community. André agreed but noted that such efforts often come in phases, depending on available time.

## Topic 3: Real-World Translation Handling Scenarios

Eric described a customer case that directly reflected the team’s goals for translation handling. The client was transitioning from multiple language-specific trees to a single-tree approach using real translations to benefit from DeepL integration.

During this migration, the customer wanted to maintain navigation consistency across languages, which required linking old and new pages across language layers. Eric explained that he had implemented a custom menu processor but ran into issues with passing the language parameter through nested navigation structures and content elements.

He noted that the situation illustrated the importance of identifying languages by their intrinsic character rather than their database IDs (`sys_language_uid`), aligning with the initiative’s objectives for future-proof translation architecture.

## Topic 4: DeepL translation extensions

The team discussed various TYPO3 DeepL translation extensions.
Eric currently uses **wv_deepltranslate**, while Martin experimented with the **autotranslate** and **wr_deepl_translate** extensions.

They compared how these extensions handle automatic translations, glossaries, and user permissions. Eric mentioned that Webvision plans to support the configuration for the new DeepL “Next-Gen Model,” which offers higher translation quality. André explained his patch to support multilingual glossaries (V3 API) in DeepL, which are still missing from the current extensions.

> “The new Glossary API supports multiple languages in a single structure—exactly what we need,” André explained.

Both agreed that the extensions are actively maintained and that the integration of API configuration options would be of great value to developers and integrators.

## Thema 5: Die Zukunft mehrsprachiger Systeme und browserbasierter Übersetzungen

Die Diskussion verlagerte sich auf die langfristige Relevanz der Mehrsprachigkeit von TYPO3. Martin stellte die Frage, ob die Übersetzungsfunktion in CMS angesichts der zunehmenden Verbreitung browserbasierter Übersetzungsfunktionen bald überflüssig werden könnte.

Eric entgegnete, dass redaktionell kuratierte Übersetzungen weiterhin von Bedeutung sein würden, insbesondere aus Gründen der Lokalisierung und Suchmaschinenoptimierung. Er betonte, dass serverseitige Übersetzungen für die Suchindexierung und die Eigentumsrechte an Inhalten weiterhin wichtig seien.

Beide waren sich einig, dass KI- und Browser-Technologien zwar den Bedarf an manuellen Übersetzungen verringern könnten, TYPO3 jedoch weiterhin strukturierte Möglichkeiten zur Darstellung von Lokalisierungsebenen benötigen würde – möglicherweise in einer Weiterentwicklung von „Sprachen” zu umfassenderen „Dimensionen”.
