## Topic 1: Issues with Sorting in Translated Records

The team discussed inconsistencies in sorting when creating translated records using the language selection dropdown in the backend. Eric demonstrated that in TYPO3 v12, the sorting behaves correctly, while in v13 anomalies occur. It appears that translated elements sometimes inherit incorrect sorting values.

Jo confirmed that recent changes to the Page module and its drag-and-drop JavaScript logic might have introduced regressions affecting content ordering. André and Eric further tested different scenarios and concluded that older incorrect sorting values might still influence the behavior unless overwritten through content rearrangement.

## Topic 2: Regression and Changes in TYPO3 v13.4.x

Jo elaborated on regressions in TYPO3 13.4.6 and 13.4.7, specifically mentioning structural changes in the Page module and layout-related modifications. These changes may affect both backend behavior and data handling in translated content. The team acknowledged the need for version comparisons and further validation to isolate the root cause of observed sorting issues.

## Topic 3: AI-Supported Concept Structure

Eric shared the AI-generated outline based on past meeting transcripts. The purpose was to use it as a draft to build a structured concept for the initiative. The team discussed refining this outline, noting that certain terms, such as “translation processes,” may be misleading and downplay the initiative's deeper architectural goals.

Astrid emphasized the need for clearer communication that the initiative aims for a complete technical overhaul rather than minor UI/UX improvements. The suggestion was made to adjust the language in the introduction to reflect the bold vision and include an explicit statement that the goals include fundamental changes to TYPO3's translation architecture.

## Topic 4: Strategic Budget – Timing the Next Attempt

The group discussed the timing and approach for re-submitting a budget request to the TYPO3 Association. It was agreed that submitting the proposal after the upcoming board election would be more strategic. This would ensure alignment with the new leadership and reduce the risk of conflicts or misunderstandings.

The focus lies on clearly communicating the initiative’s intentions and technical direction to demonstrate why funding for the **development of a proper concept** is both necessary and worthwhile. Eric noted that the TYPO3 Camp Mitteldeutschland may provide opportunities to explain the initiative’s goals in informal conversations, potentially laying groundwork for future support.

## Topic 5: Petition on Voting Rules and Election Concerns

Jo informed the team about a petition suggesting that board candidates should require at least 50% of the total votes to be elected. Based on the current wording, the team expressed concern that such a rule might not be mathematically feasible under the existing voting system and could unintentionally exclude qualified candidates, particularly from underrepresented regions.

However, it was also acknowledged that the petition’s wording might simply be **unclear or misleading**, and the intended meaning could differ from the literal interpretation. The team assumes that a clarification or revision is likely before any implementation.

It was confirmed that the petition would **not** affect the current election, as the vote on the petition is scheduled after the election results are announced.

## Topic 6: Refining the Concept's Introduction

The team debated the phrasing and positioning of the initiative’s goals in the concept document. Astrid argued that the current draft downplays the magnitude of the planned changes. Jo and Eric agreed that the wording should reflect a strong, ambitious vision and clarify that the initiative aims to fundamentally restructure TYPO3’s translation handling.

The idea of using ChatGPT to rephrase and sharpen the introduction text was welcomed, with an emphasis on ensuring clarity, precision, and appropriate tone to match the scope of the work.

## Topic 7: Next Meeting

Due to Eric’s attendance at the TYPO3 Camp Mitteldeutschland and scheduling constraints, the team decided to cancel the next meeting. They will reconvene in two weeks to continue refining the concept and discuss outcomes from the camp session.
