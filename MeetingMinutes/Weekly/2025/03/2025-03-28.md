## Topic 1: Motivation and Scope of the Cross-System Evaluation

Olivier introduced his intentions for a comparative study of translation systems across various CMS platforms. The goal is to evaluate how TYPO3 stands in relation to modern systems like Pimcore, Storyblok, Strapi, and enterprise solutions like Adobe and Sitecore. He emphasized that the aim is not to pass judgment but to provide a neutral, detailed comparison that can support strategic decisions and possibly future funding applications. This study is intended to be an open document with clear sources and potentially include contributions from experts such as Daniel Zielinski.

## Topic 2: Importance of Visibility and Systematic Evaluation

Jo appreciated the effort to benchmark TYPO3’s strengths and weaknesses in translation handling, highlighting that TYPO3 often lacks comparative evaluations despite its self-image as a leader in multilingual capabilities. Eric supported this by stressing the need to consider how TYPO3 compares, not just from a functional but also from a visibility standpoint. The discussion covered the benefit of showcasing TYPO3’s advanced capabilities against popular systems like WordPress, which require plugins for multilingual support.

## Topic 3: Integration with AI and Future Developments

The team discussed the relevance of AI-based translation processes, noting that some enterprises already rely solely on tools like DeepL, with human editors reviewing the output. Eric mentioned the existing integration efforts, including the AI-Suite and an upcoming extension from davitec. Olivier described this as the beginning of a wave of innovations, comparing it to early surfers catching promising waves. The discussion reinforced the need for a foundational structure in TYPO3 to support such innovations and integrations moving forward.

## Topic 4: Roadmap and Internal Coordination

Eric emphasized the connection between Olivier’s findings and the initiative’s internal plans, such as removing the `-1` language fallback and transitioning to language-tag-based identification. He noted that the current limitations in TYPO3’s core make certain enhancements complex, and having a strategic roadmap would help align future developments. The importance of coordination with the Core Team was also stressed.

## Topic 5: Funding, Strategy, and Transition to Team Status

The conversation shifted to the funding and strategic implications of their work. Jo suggested that a well-structured concept document could help secure funding from sources outside the TYPO3 Association, such as governmental or EU programs. Eric pointed out that a funded concept would accelerate progress significantly compared to relying solely on volunteer work. Olivier described how the initiative might evolve into an official team once a concrete strategy and concept are in place, referencing the example of the Content Types Team.

## Topic 6: Documentation of the Current State

Astrid offered to contribute to documenting TYPO3's current translation handling state. This would include topics like fallback types, Free/Connected Mode, `Language All`, and language synchronization. The idea is to leverage existing internal knowledge and notes to form a solid foundation for Olivier’s broader study. Eric agreed this should be developed in Markdown and ideally published openly via GitHub. The documentation should serve as a reusable and quotable source for further planning and external communication.

## Topic 7: Dissemination and Communication

Olivier proposed several dissemination strategies for increasing visibility, including blog posts, DevDays, Barcamps, and possibly a podcast episode to reach broader audiences. Eric shared positive feedback from his recent Barcamp presentation, noting growing interest and affirming the relevance of the initiative’s goals. The team agreed that raising awareness within the TYPO3 community and beyond is essential for long-term success.

## Topic 8: Technical Planning and Next Steps

Eric emphasized the importance of beginning with a clear outline for the concept document. This would help frame the discussion and allow contributors to propose chapters, whether voluntarily or compensated. Olivier welcomed any collaboration and reiterated that contributions to his analysis—especially for TYPO3’s current state—would be financially supported where appropriate. The plan is to use GitHub for collaborative writing and version control.
