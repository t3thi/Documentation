## Topic 1: Meeting Scheduling and Absences

Eric mentioned that he will be absent next Friday due to attending the Agency Roundtable. Astrid noted she would also be unavailable for the remainder of September. André suggested skipping the next meeting and using the time for coding instead. The next official meeting is planned for September 19.

## Topic 2: Reactivating the Translation Handling Extension

Eric proposed reviving the Translation Handling Extension to provide better visualization and testing support beyond CSV tables. The goal is to generate content trees in various fallback types, include real content output, and handle cases involving `-1` language IDs in both parent and child elements. This would facilitate backend and frontend testing of complex translation behaviors.

There was a discussion about TYPO3 v14 compatibility. Astrid reported that her version of the extension runs in the latest core, although with some uncommitted adjustments. Eric and André noted that certain adjustments are still needed due to API changes in TYPO3 v14.

## Topic 3: Behavior of Language `-1` in Parent-Child Relationships

The team analyzed a specific test case where a parent content element (in language `-1`) contains children in different languages (`0`, `1`, `-1`). They observed that in both default and translated views, all children are rendered regardless of language, which raised questions about whether this behavior is a feature or a bug.

Jo raised concerns, stating that this is an invalid configuration and should be prevented by the system. Eric and André noted that such setups are currently possible through backend configuration and could be interpreted as a feature for editorial convenience. Jo emphasized the importance of aligning language IDs across parent and child elements to ensure consistency.

## Topic 4: Strategy for Test Case Creation and Migration Path

The team debated whether the current behavior should be fixed before or after removing `-1` language support. Eric suggested that tackling the removal first might be more efficient, though it would result in a more complex migration path. Jo favored fixing the bug first to simplify the future transition.

André proposed implementing structured test cases in the team’s extension to replicate the current core behavior. These tests will later serve as the foundation for core tests. Everyone agreed to prioritize building out the team’s internal test extension before creating patches for the TYPO3 core.

## Topic 5: Handling Complex Relation Types and Extension Structure

The discussion shifted toward structuring the extension to cover various relation types, including:

- Simple inline (`IRRE`) relations
- M:N relations using MM tables
- Direct record references via select boxes

Astrid mentioned that the current setup, which generates content elements across all fallback types and translation modes, is becoming increasingly complex. She advocated for generating only the necessary test cases to keep the environment manageable.

Eric suggested a structure similar to the Styleguide Extension, where each test case is clearly defined and optionally generated. The team discussed introducing a naming convention and organizational logic to avoid overwhelming complexity while ensuring all test cases can be visualized and replicated consistently.

## Topic 6: Page Structure and Content Organization

Jo recommended avoiding excessive nesting in the page tree and instead placing multiple use cases under a single logical page to maintain manageability. André and Astrid suggested separating use cases by fallback type and translation mode, and using clear page titles to indicate each configuration.

The team agreed on implementing a configurable generator for the extension that allows selecting specific fallback types and content configurations (e.g., `IRRE` child relations). This generator would produce standardized test setups that could later be used to generate reproducible core test data.

## Topic 7: Allow Language Synchronization and TCA Variants

Astrid raised the issue of the overwhelming number of combinations arising from toggling `allowLanguageSynchronization`, `l10n_mode`, and other TCA settings. The team debated whether all valid permutations should be represented or only those deemed logical and meaningful.

Jo clarified that in `connected` mode, `allowLanguageSynchronization` should not apply to inline elements, and that this needs to be validated. The team resolved to focus first on documenting the current core behavior—regardless of whether it’s considered ideal—and progressively structure their extension to reflect those scenarios.

## Topic 8: Alignment with Core Test Structures

Astrid suggested aligning the team’s test case naming with TYPO3 core tests to ease transition and clarity. Eric proposed an iterative schema that expands as new dimensions become relevant. The group emphasized the importance of maintainable, searchable, and extensible naming conventions for all future test cases.

## Topic 9: Implementation Planning and Next Steps

The team agreed to:

- Use their internal extension to define and document test cases before integrating them into core tests.
- Focus on TYPO3 v14 compatibility.
- Begin with simple `IRRE` relations and expand incrementally.
- Structure the extension around testable, reproducible content configurations with naming aligned to core test expectations.

Final planning details included:
- André will continue coding and explore structure ideas.
- Astrid and Eric plan to coordinate during TYPO3 Camp in Munich.
- Astrid may join development in early October depending on availability.

## Topic 10: Upcoming Availability

Astrid and Eric confirmed their attendance at TYPO3 Camp Munich and mentioned they’d be unavailable on September 12. Jo will be away from September 19 through early October, attending multiple events including the first TYPO3 Camp UK. André plans to use the interim period for further development work on the extension.
