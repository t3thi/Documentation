## Topic 1: Iterative Strategy Shift

Eric introduced Steffen to the current strategic shift within the initiative. Previously, the team had tried to fully define the complete architecture and conceptualize a finished solution before implementing changes. This approach had proven ineffective due to the complexity and number of unknowns.

Inspired by Lolli’s methodology in Core development, the team now focuses on taking small, clearly defined steps guided by an overall—but blurry—vision. Each completed step helps reveal the next logical move.

## Topic 2: Long-Term Vision and Language Identification

Eric explained the overarching vision to Steffen: improving the flexibility of language handling in TYPO3. The long-term goal is to move toward identifying languages using standardized BCP 47 language tags instead of numeric `sys_language_uid` values.

This would open up new possibilities—for example, consistent language referencing across root sites or improved handling of language-specific file assets. These improvements aim to make multilingual setups more robust, scalable, and less dependent on internal system configurations.

## Topic 3: Addressing Special Values in `sys_language_uid`

The initiative is focusing on removing the special value `-1` from the `sys_language_uid` field. This value currently enables content to be shown across all languages but leads to conceptual and technical inconsistencies, particularly in sorting and translation workflows.

To retain the editorial benefit of shared content, a new boolean flag will be introduced. When enabled, this flag triggers automated duplication of the content record into all language layers via DataHandler. This ensures full compatibility and resolves sorting issues, as every language gets a dedicated record.

## Topic 4: Preparation Through Core Testing

Eric emphasized that before changing Core behavior, the initiative is focusing on writing comprehensive tests. These will ensure current behaviors—especially those involving `-1`—are properly documented and reproducible.

A dedicated testing extension has been developed for this purpose. It allows deterministic creation of content in different translation modes (Free, Connected, Mixed) and supports all three fallback types: **strict**, **fallback**, and **free**. The extension will be used to identify and cover edge cases in the TYPO3 Core.


## Topic 5: Migration Strategy and Deprecation Policy

The preferred approach for removing `-1` is through a migration process rather than patching individual bugs. This would allow existing TYPO3 installations to be converted to a future-proof setup without breaking functionality.

Eric reaffirmed the initiative’s alignment with TYPO3 Core’s deprecation policy. Breaking changes will be preceded by proper deprecation warnings and will be introduced only in accordance with Core release timelines—likely beginning in v15, with more significant changes in v16.

## Topic 6: UX and UI Issues in Translation Modes

Eric demonstrated several inconsistencies in the Page Module’s drag & drop behavior across TYPO3 versions. Specifically, elements in Connected Mode can be unintentionally switched to Free Mode via drag & drop, breaking the structural relationship between translations.

These issues will be filed as Core bugs. Eric also discussed the behavior of the “Transfusion” extension, which was developed to manually manage and repair translation connections, including “educated suggestions” for record reconnections.

## Topic 7: Future Outlook and Unified Translation Handling

Looking forward, the initiative aims to eliminate the need for Free, Connected, and Mixed modes altogether. The proposed model involves:

- Storing full structure per language layer.
- Creating “shadow records” in other languages when new content is added.
- Ensuring structural consistency across all languages regardless of default language.

This would allow full editorial flexibility while maintaining technical integrity and reducing complexity.
