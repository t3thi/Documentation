# Translation Handling Initiative<br>Team Meeting Minutes

[← Back to the overview](https://notes.typo3.org/s/f3ae8fZSD)

- **Date:** 2025-09-19<br>
- **Where:** [Slack Huddle](https://app.slack.com/huddle/T024TUMLZ/C05D7UF1L8M)
- **Participants:**
    - André Buchmann
    - Eric Harrer
- **No participation:**
    - Astrid Haubold
    - Jo Hasenau
    - Sven Wappler

## Topic 1: Meeting Rhythm and Contribution Focus

Eric and André discussed whether the current meeting format is still effective. Given limited time and the desire for tangible output, they considered reducing the meeting frequency to bi-weekly or monthly in order to allocate more time for coding. They agreed that bi-weekly meetings are a good balance and suggested that on off-weeks, informal coding sessions could be held instead.

Additionally, they proposed assigning tasks ("homework") between meetings to maintain momentum and accountability, while noting that it's acceptable if tasks are not always completed on time.

## Topic 2: Refactoring CLI Commands and Extension Improvements

Eric introduced recent changes to the [Translation Handling Extension](https://github.com/t3thi/translation-handling):

- The CLI now uses dedicated commands instead of a flag-based approach. This simplifies the code and command-line usage.
- He removed the term "Generator" from command names, now using `translation-handling:create` and `translation-handling:delete`.
- Symfony service definitions were simplified using PHP attributes and constructor DI, making the codebase cleaner and more modern.

André reviewed and approved the changes, noting they align well with the project's direction.

## Topic 3: Bug in File Directory Deletion

The team discussed a bug in the Translation Handling Extension: when deleting one of multiple root sites, the associated file directory is removed, causing broken file references in the remaining trees.

They proposed two solutions:

- Creating dedicated directories per root site.
- Implementing a reference check before deletion, similar to the TYPO3 FileList Module.

Eric documented the issue in a ticket for future resolution.

## Topic 4: Content Creation Strategy and Randomization

The current content generator uses randomization to create translation states, but this approach makes test cases less predictable. Eric proposed replacing randomized generation with fixed, deterministic content states to support automated testing and reproducibility.

> "Fixed Solution for Randomized Content Translation" will help keep test results consistent and maintainable, especially with future automated testing.

They agreed to:

- Remove random logic for translation states.
- Define a consistent pattern, such as alternating localized and unlocalized content.

## Topic 5: Refactoring Content Generation Code

The team acknowledged the current implementation of content generation is difficult to read and maintain. They discussed restructuring the code using events or dedicated classes for each content scenario. This would allow modular extensions of different use cases, e.g., adding IRRE elements, records, menus, etc.

Multiple approaches were considered:

- Event-driven architecture.
- Dedicated PHP classes per content type with a `toArray()` method.

A refactoring task was documented to explore these options and improve code clarity.

## Topic 6: Connected, Free, and Mixed Mode Concerns

They examined inconsistencies in TYPO3’s behavior regarding language modes:

- In the Connected Mode, it is currently possible to cause Mixed Mode inconsistencies via drag-and-drop, even unintentionally.
- Children records do not inherit language changes from parent records, regardless of mode.

Eric demonstrated how easily Mixed Mode can be triggered in TYPO3 v13 and v14, and how misleading it can be to users.

They agreed on the need for a clearer UX, suggesting:

- Drag-and-drop across languages should be disabled in Connected Mode.
- A Core issue should be filed to raise awareness with the UX/JavaScript team.
- Possibly introduce a "Switch to Free Mode" button in the UI, but **only** when in Mixed Mode to avoid encouraging disruptive changes from Connected Mode.

## Topic 7: Revisiting the Transfusion Extension

Eric and André discussed the previous [Transfusion Extension](https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/transfusion) that helped resolve Mixed Mode inconsistencies. They considered reviving or rethinking it, possibly as a UI wizard triggered only in Mixed Mode. The wizard could:

- Suggest connections based on `l10n_source`.
- Offer manual assignment where automatic matching fails.
- Allow users to disconnect or reconnect elements safely.

However, Eric emphasized that long-term efforts should focus on eliminating the need for Mixed and Free Modes altogether. He suggested deprioritizing wizard development in favor of contributing Core Patches related to `sys_language_uid = -1`.

## Topic 8: Content Seeder and AI Integration Ideas

André proposed that TYPO3 could benefit from a built-in content seeder, similar to other CMS platforms, to generate realistic dummy content for demos, development, or AI scenarios.

Eric mentioned the [interest extension](https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/interest) by Matthias Bolt Lesniak as a potential reference. While not directly useful for the Translation Handling Extension, it serves as inspiration for how content generation and record linking could be approached using `DataHandler`.

## Topic 9: Prioritizing Core Contribution: `sys_language_uid = -1`

The team confirmed that their top priority remains supporting Core development related to `sys_language_uid = -1`. Before investing time into advanced tooling (e.g., Transfusion wizard), they aim to:

- Expand test cases in the Translation Handling Extension, particularly around `-1` language content.
- Use those cases to inform Core tests and eventually Core patches.

## Topic 10: Homework Assignments

The following tasks were noted for follow-up:

- **Eric**: Implement check to prevent file directory deletion if references exist.
- **André**: Begin refactoring the content generation code to prepare for future use cases.
- Both: Review and expand cases involving `sys_language_uid = -1` in the extension before moving on to Core contributions.
