## Topic 1: Review of the Concept Draft

Eric and Astrid discussed the current state analysis document that Astrid has been working on. Eric mentioned he had read through most of it and shared initial feedback on the approach and clarity. They reflected on the need to define the intended audience more clearly, particularly balancing between TYPO3 insiders and external readers. Astrid noted that while she tried to include technical details, the goal was to keep the initial draft approachable.

There was also an extended exchange about the terminology used—specifically around `Translation Modes`, backend vs. frontend logic, and terms like `Free` and `Connected`. They identified potential confusion due to reused terminology and discussed possible renaming strategies to improve clarity.

## Topic 2: Multidimensional Translation Handling

Eric introduced the idea of extending TYPO3's translation system to handle multiple dimensions, such as language and country separately. He referenced a conversation with Stefan Neufeind, who had a use case involving different content per country-language combination. André elaborated with examples from systems like Shopware, where channels allow for more flexible outputs depending on the context.

They discussed potential implementations using routing and `Context Aspects` to determine the correct content variant. Eric suggested that even if TYPO3 doesn’t support multiple dimensions yet, the concept should remain in consideration for future development. Astrid emphasized that her primary goal was still to fix the basic translation workflows and reduce redundancy in content maintenance.

## Topic 3: Clarifying Technical Concepts

Several parts of the concept draft were reviewed in detail:

- The `Language Field` in the `TCA` was discussed, particularly the meaning of special values like `0` and `-1`.
- The differences between backend translation handling (`Page Module`, record editing) and frontend configuration (`Site Configuration`, overlays, fallbacks) were emphasized.
- The group explored potential improvements in the UI to help editors better understand how content is rendered in different languages.

Eric and Astrid considered whether to include examples or a matrix outlining valid and invalid configurations of translation modes and fallbacks. While they agreed it might be too detailed for the current draft, it could be useful for internal reference or later documentation.

## Topic 4: Performance and Maintenance Concerns

Towards the end of the meeting, Astrid asked for input on potential performance or scalability issues related to translation handling. Eric and André noted that the complexity of managing content in the backend increases significantly with many languages. Eric also identified TYPO3's forced one-dimensional approach as a potential scalability bottleneck, especially for larger multilingual and multi-regional projects.
