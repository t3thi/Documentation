## Topic 1: Transitioning from `sys_language_uid` -1

### `pages` is not affected, but `tt_content` is in any case. What about other tables, and what impact does this have?

- The team clarified that while the `pages` table is not impacted, `tt_content` and all other records using translation fields are affected by the transition. The focus should be on the core functionalities and methods affected by the `sys_language_uid` -1 identifier.
- Third-party extensions are excluded from consideration, as they may potentially alter core functionality. This ensures that the analysis remains focused on TYPO3 Core features and their correct behavior.
- These include:
    - **Extbase Context:** All repository methods that fetch records from localized tables.
    - **Non-Extbase Context:** Methods in `PageRepository` and `BackendUtility`.
    - **TypoScript Objects:** Any objects triggering database queries with translation considerations.
- A comprehensive analysis will identify areas where adjustments are needed to handle the removal of `-1` effectively, ensuring alignment with the broader translation strategy.

### What are the requirements for the DataHandler code?

- The team emphasized the need for a clearly defined synchronization process in the DataHandler.
- An "enforceLanguageSynchronization" mechanism was identified as a necessary addition alongside the existing "allowLanguageSynchronization."
- The team discussed the functional distinction between treating records as a whole and focusing on individual fields. Since the relationship of content and other records to pages is managed via the `pid` field, it can be treated similarly to a relationship at the field level.
- The existing synchronization process, which operates at the field level, is expected to be reusable for these cases. However, the specific code pathways to achieve this need further exploration.

### Impact and use cases on `free` and `connected` mode

- In "free" mode, the existing behavior of `sys_language_uid` -1 leads to inconsistencies in sorting across languages. This issue will be resolved through record-level synchronization.
- In "connected" mode, sorting values derived from the default language must be accurately reflected across translations to maintain consistency.
- The proposed synchronization mechanism will address these issues, providing a unified solution for both modes.

### Impact on the existing sorting algorithm in the DataHandler

- The current sorting algorithm relies on the default language, which creates discrepancies in "free" mode.
- Transitioning away from `-1` will allow for independent sorting values in each language, ensuring consistent behavior across all modes.

### What additional data may need to be processed in the DataHandler?

- The team discussed that additional data might need to be tracked to ensure synchronization processes run smoothly.
- This includes status information indicating whether a record has already been synchronized and whether the synchronization was successful.
- Such data could be stored in a dedicated table or as additional fields within existing tables to support efficient handling of complex scenarios.

### Remaining Points


- Due to time constraints, the team was unable to address all points from Lolli's list in this meeting. The remaining items will be discussed and documented in the next session to ensure a comprehensive and well-documented approach.
## Topic 2: Conceptual Framework for Strategy Development

The discussion shifted to the broader strategy development for the initiative. While the elimination of the language identifier -1 is noted as an important first step, the focus of the strategy paper should be broader. Nevertheless, the paper must contain enough detail to address the questions outlined in Lolli's list, specifying the steps required to achieve the goals.

While the document will aim to provide concrete guidance, the team emphasized the need for agility during implementation, as new insights are likely to emerge in the details throughout the process. This balance between detailed planning and adaptability will be crucial to the successful implementation of concrete solutions.
