## Topic 1: Personal Workload and Motivation

Eric shared that he is currently focusing more on balancing work and personal life. He emphasized that contributing to the initiative is something he genuinely enjoys and is motivated to continue working on, even if at a slower, more sustainable pace.

## Topic 2: Evaluation Strategy for Current Findings

The team discussed how to proceed with the existing list of findings. Two possible approaches were considered:

- Building a deterministic analysis tool (e.g., using a PHP AST parser) to systematically detect all relevant occurrences of `-1`.
- Manually reviewing the existing findings, evaluating their validity, and ensuring proper Core test coverage.

While the idea of developing an AST-based analysis tool was considered interesting, André and Eric agreed that the more effective immediate step would be to analyze the existing findings, determine which are valid or false positives, and verify whether the relevant logic is already tested or requires additional test coverage.

## Topic 3: Identification of False Positives in the Current Findings

As part of the manual review, the team examined several findings in more detail and identified multiple false positives. One central insight was:

> **Pages can never have the language value `-1`.**

As a result, any logic related to menu generation or language handling that relies on `Pages` can be excluded from the list of relevant findings. This includes, for example, the `LanguageMenu` and parts of the `hreflang` generator, which were deemed irrelevant for the analysis.

## Topic 4: Records and Extension-Specific Findings

Not all findings were false positives. For instance:

- The `RecordsXmlSitemapDataProvider` includes logic that explicitly checks for "All Languages", confirming it as a **valid finding**.

This highlighted the importance of reviewing each case individually rather than applying global assumptions.

## Topic 5: Spreadsheet to Track Findings

To coordinate the ongoing review, the team agreed to document the findings in a Markdown-based table, including:

- Finding location and description
- Manual review status
- Test coverage status
- Comments or links to relevant code
- Validity (valid / false positive)

The goal is to ensure structured processing and collaboration over the coming weeks.

## Topic 6: Use of `-1` in Non-Standard Contexts
The team discussed cases where `-1` is used in a different semantic context—specifically, as a way to represent that a record is not associated with any language. An example of this is found in the Link Validator, where link records need to be marked as “not related to any specific language.” Since `0` and positive integers would each indicate a concrete language, `-1` was used as a workaround to express “no language”.

Eric and André agreed that introducing `NULL` as an additional value in an integer-based field is not a meaningful solution in this context. Instead, such uses of `-1`, which are semantically unrelated to the “all languages” case currently under review, will be left as-is for now. They will be addressed and potentially replaced once the language field is migrated to a string-based format in the future.

## Topic 7: Deprecation and Migration Vision

The team outlined a long-term plan for phasing out the usage of `-1` in language handling:

- Marking direct checks for `-1` as deprecated.
- Replacing them with utility methods that abstract the logic.
- Communicating these changes to extension developers.
- Fully removing support for `-1` in TYPO3 v15, transitioning to string-based language identifiers.

## Topic 8: Remaining Findings and Evaluation

The team reviewed several other findings:

- **PagesWithoutDescriptionDataProvider** (seo): Marked as a false positive, as it operates on `Pages`.
- **HrefLangGenerator** (seo): Still under investigation due to potential edge cases involving `News` records.
- **RecordsXmlSitemapDataProvider** (seo): Confirmed as a valid finding.
- **ReviewController** (workspaces): Involves backend language selector logic; usage of `-1` is limited to displaying "All Languages" in backend UIs and is not relevant for content logic. Marked as a false positive.

These evaluations will be documented in the findings table.

## Topic 9: Coordination with Lolli and Next Steps

Eric reported that Lolli is unavailable until after the TYPO3 v14.1 release and will likely rejoin discussions after that point. Until then, the team will continue reviewing findings and contributing to the shared documentation and evaluations.
