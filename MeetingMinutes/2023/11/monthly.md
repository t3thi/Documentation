# Translation Handling Initiative: Monthly report
**November 2023**

[← Back to the overview](https://notes.typo3.org/s/f3ae8fZSD)

## What happened since the last report?
This is our first report since the initiative was founded.

We focused on the following topics last month:
- **Developing a workflow to document our work in the initiative**
    - Creation of weekly meeting minutes with the help of AI (currently [Noota](https://www.noota.io/)) and, of course, human review and rephrasing
- **Further elaboration of the community survey on translation handling**
    - We are in the process of completing the question pool with the help of ChatGPT and based on the data collected so far from the TYPO3 community.
- **Familiarization/understanding of the current core functionality**
    - We are looking into the free/connected mode when translating content and the possibilities of switching between the two modes
    - We are currently investigating the fallback types that can be defined in the site configuration and their effects. In this context, we are discussing to what extent the fallback behavior can be improved based on our own experience.
- **Discussion of possible core improvements**
    - We have continued to discuss the concept of the default language and the extent to which the structuring property can be handled in a language-independent way to pave the way for things like a translatable page tree.
    - We are currently working on a translatable page tree prototype in the TYPO3 backend
    - We have further explored the idea of storing languages according to BCP47.
- **Development of a translation handling extension**
    - We have set ourselves the goal of developing an extension that will help with the external and internal communication of translation handling test cases in the future
    - The extension is currently being developed along the lines of the Style Guide extension
- **We investigate/sort tickets on Forge that relate to our current topics**

## What will happen until the next report?
We want to ...
- complete the questions in our community survey so that we can consider the basic substance of the questions to be asked to be complete. On this basis, we want to gradually improve the content.
- further develop our translation handling extension
- further develop the translatable page tree prototype
- continue working on the core functionality and deepen our understanding of the internal
- continue working with Forge tickets with regard to translation handling and clarify/check whether tickets from older core versions are still relevant in their current state.processes.

## Any scope changes?
- So far, nothing has changed in the scope of our initiative.
- Our website is up to date.
- We are currently continuing to pursue our previously mentioned focal points. These have not changed since the initiative was founded.

## Need help?
- As part of the translatable page tree prototype and possibly as part of the development of a free/connected mode switch, we need expertise in TypeScript. We already have Andreas Kienast and Andreas Nedbal in mind as possible contacts. Sven Wappler and/or Jo Hasenau will contact them in due course if specific questions arise.
- We will need support with community surveys in due course. As soon as we have finalized our pool of questions within the group, support with the formal design of the survey would be desirable.

## Any last words
In the current line-up with Eric, Sven, Jo, Astrid and André, we have become a committed, energetic team that already has a lot of experience with multilingual projects and is motivated to further optimize the processes in TYPO3.

We have agreed on weekly meetings (always Friday from 11:00 to 12:00).
The regular team communication sharpens our understanding of the internal TYPO3 processes and lays a good foundation for the development of core improvements.
